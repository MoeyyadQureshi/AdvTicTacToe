# Advanced Tic Tac Toe
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in terminal. 

4 years ago, I made this same game as a learning project to get familiar with Python. I don't have that code anymore, but I'm sure it was absolutely horrid. Decided to remake this with good software design practices as a fun throwback

Just run `game.py` to play!
