# Advanced Tic Tac Toe
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in terminal. 

What makes it advanced? Beginners to programming often try to build Tic-Tac-Toe as one of their first learning projects. This is something I did 4 years ago while I learning Python. I decided to rebuild this game and see how different my code looks now vs when I first began.
